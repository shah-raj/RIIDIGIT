## Digit Recognizer

**A Machine Learning Project that recognizes handwritten single digits**

The working Javascript model on HTML is hosted [here](https://shah-raj.github.io/Handwritten-Digit-Recognition/)

- Uses the MNIST dataset. Original dataset [found here](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/). Another convenient option from the Keras library can be [found here](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/datasets/mnist/load_data)
- Implements Convolutional Neural Networks


To implement the model follow the steps:
  1. Extract the testing and training dataset in **mnist_test.csv.zip** and **mnist_train.csv.zip**.
  2. Preferably set up a new virtual environment in your Python installation and activate it. [More info](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)
  3. Install the packages in Requirements.txt in this environment.
  4. Open the Jupyter notebook **'Handwritten digits recognition.ipynb'**.
  5. Change the path of the testing and training dataset with respect to your computer.
  6. Run all the cells in the notebook.
